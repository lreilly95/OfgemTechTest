Client will build request in front-end.
Request sent to API as string.
Split string at operators to get operators and operands.
If using bracket functionality, evaluate calculations inside brackets first.


Front end : -
	Request consists of IP Address, Date & Time of request, and a calculation.
	A calculation consists of Operand 1, Operand 2, and an Operator.
	Brackets can be used to make the result of a calculation an Operand.

Disallow dividing by 0.

For division operations, which do not commute, Operand 1 is the numerator, Operand 2 is the denominator; in this case Operand 2 must not be 0.


TODO

Fix error when 1st character in calculation is parenthesis.
Create SQLite DB on startup if no DB exists.  x
Pretty up the front-end.
Add operator associativity, and exponentiation.
Add negative number functionality.
